Charlotte Malterre-Barthes is an architect, urban designer, and Assistant Professor of Urban Design at Harvard Graduate School of Design. Malterre-Barthes’ interests are related to urgent aspects of contemporary urbanization and how struggling communities can gain greater access to resources, the mainstream economy, better governance, and ecological/social justice—work she defines as the strategic practice of urban design. While directing the MAS Urban Design at the Chair of Marc Angélil, Malterre-Barthes has earned her doctoral degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich on the political economy of commodities on the built environment. She is the coauthor of prize-winning books Housing Cairo: The Informal Response (2016), Some Haunted Spaces in Singapore (2018), and Migrant Marseille: Architectures of Social Segregation and Urban Inclusivity (2020). Malterre-Barthes is a founding member of the Parity Group and of the Parity Front, activist networks dedicated to improving gender equality and diversity in architecture.
