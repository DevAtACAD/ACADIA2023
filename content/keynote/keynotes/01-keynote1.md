Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello are the alchemists and architects behind the Oakland based think-tank Rael San Fratello and the make-tank Emerging Objects. A primary focus of their work folds together indigenous and traditional craft and material practice, contemporary design technologies, and storytelling, as strategies to unravel the complexities of contemporary society. Humor, play, and hybridity are important aspects of the work of Rael San Fratello, often layered with serious topics that span the themes of immigration, start-up companies, waste, homelessness, fashion, graphic design, and 3D printing.  You can see their drawings, models, and objects in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Design Museum in London.
