**REALIGNMENTS: Toward Critical Computation**


At the convergence of social, political, and environmental crises and a global pandemic, ACADIA2021 reflects on realigning our practices to allow for alternative and constructive ways of knowledge and world making to address these issues. 

Realignments: Toward Critical Computation requires resonance across technical tools and conceptual approaches. The conference invites submissions of recent research, practice, and theory that align with but are not limited to integrations of the following approaches and methods.

## Approaches
   - Critical Computation, Participatory, and Emancipatory Design
   - Computational Publics
   - Intersectionality in Computational Design 
   - Interdisciplinarity, and Experiments in Collaboration
   - Data, Bias, and Ethics 
   - Politics of Access
   - Environmental Crisis
   - Architectures of Care 
   - Design Emergency 
   - Cities, Health, and Policies



## Methods and Tools
  - Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Statistical Approaches
  - Robotic Construction, and Operations
  - Distributed Fabrication, and Inter/Intra Operability 
  - Adaptation, Responsiveness, and Interactivity
  - New Materials, and Construction Practices
  - Spatial Computing, Sensing, and VR/AR/MR
  - Environmental, and Regenerative Design
  - Low vs. High Tech, and Analog vs. Digital
  - Emerging Pedagogies
