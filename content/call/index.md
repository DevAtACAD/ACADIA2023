We invite submissions addressing one or more, but not limited to, the following themes:

## Adaptation and Disruption
- Computational design and health
- Retooling of fabrication and robotic craft
- Emergent modes of practice and cross-disciplinary collaboration
- Biological interactions, environmental responsiveness, ecological adaptation

## Performative Synthesis
- Simulation, prototyping, and energy modeling
- Environmental tectonics and performance optimization
- Augmented construction and synthetic workflows


## Material Processes
- Emergent and self-organizing material systems
- Composite matter, biomaterials, and synthetics
- Programmable matter and advanced material design


## Resilient Automation
- Artificial Intelligence: theory, practice, aesthetics
- Robotic construction, fabrication, and operation
- Machine learning: between expediency and sensibility
- Real-time sensing and interaction, from the material to the urban scales
- Procedural and algorithmic workflows and labor


## Computational Cultures
- The emergence of novel design cultures, representations, and aesthetics
- Architectures of care

- Notes on lab work and behind-the-scenes (glassbox vs blackbox)
- Politics of access


## SUBMISSION TYPES & DEADLINES

1. Technical Papers: Extended Abstracts
This year, given the extraordinary circumstances, ACADIA 2020 will shift from a full paper submission to a blind peer-review extended abstract submission format (1000-words). Extended abstracts selected for presentation to the conference will be invited to produce a short video presentation for the conference, and will be invited to submit full-length papers (4000-word Full papers or 2000-word Work-In-Progress Papers) for publication in the proceedings. Published papers will be included in the CumInCad database. All ACADIA papers are searchable through ResearchGate and Scopus.

   - Extended Abstract Submission Deadline: June 15, 2020 Extended to June 24, 2020
   - Notification of Acceptance: August 18, 2020
   - Presentation Videos Due: October 1, 2020
   - Paper Submissions Due: November 20, 2020
   - Review Period for Final Papers: December, 2020
   - Final Paper Submissions Due for Proceedings: January, 2021

2. Projects
Project submissions will be blind peer reviewed. Projects will be published in a special Projects publication and featured on the ACADIA website. Select submissions may be invited to contribute a video presentation and/or participate in a discussion panel during the virtual conference. 

   - Submission Requirements: 600 word text (excluding citations and captions) plus a maximum of 10 Images
   - Submission Deadline: June 22, 2020 Extended to July 1, 2020
   - Notification of Acceptance: August 18, 2020
   - Revised/formatted materials Due: October 1, 2020

3. Videos
This year, standalone videos will be a new submission type to the ACADIA Conference, as an alternative to the traditional paper or project submission formats. Video submissions will be reviewed and selected by a jury. Simultaneous submissions to Papers/Projects and Videos are possible; each submission will be evaluated on its own merits.

   - Submission Requirements: 5-minute videos in MP4 format
   - Video Submission Deadline: June 29, 2020 Extended to July 10, 2020
   - Notification of Acceptance: August 18, 2020

4. Field Notes
Field Notes are a new submission type to the 2020 ACADIA Conference and are an invitation for shorter pieces that may include provocative artifacts regarding the culture and practice of computational design: experimental ideas, behind-the-scenes, observations, brief narratives, provocations, and manifestoes. Submissions will be jury selected and published in the Project Book and as a special feature on the ACADIA website. Select submissions may be invited to participate in a discussion panel during the virtual conference.
   
   - Submission Requirements: 800-1000 word texts max; images are permitted and image-based essays are also welcome.
   Field Notes Submission Deadline: June 22, 2020 Extended to July 10, 2020
