**Abstract**: The workshop will explore procedural workflows by integrating the use of Autodesk Maya, MASH, and Grasshopper to expose the participants to polygon modeling, parametric design and animation techniques using physics. Through a sequence of step by step operations, the workshop will demonstrate how a clear process can turn into a plethora of outcomes that can be further discretized, evaluated and assimilated into a final design proposal. The workshop will be focusing on the object, both as a static and a dynamic entity. This will be subject to computational procedures catalogued into categories including ‘Addition’, ‘Distribution’, ‘Morphing’, ‘Instancing’, ‘Aggregation’ and ‘Projection’. Architectural and tectonic qualities will begin to emerge while being tested against the use of contemporary representational techniques including animation. Participants will learn integrated and hybrid workflows by using multiple platforms in synergy while experimenting and defining the character of their ‘superobjects’.

**Description**: The workshop is oriented to students and professionals interested to learn procedural workflows to critical assemblies and physics. Each phase will start with an overall explanation of the software and interface and will end with a Q&A and design session.

**Phase 1**
Additive Fields & Forces: Grasshopper.
Distinct-Additive workflow focused on geometrical additions manipulated by field forces. Remapped images are used as initial notional values for the definition of digital aggregations in meshes generated in Grasshopper. Mesh and image resolutions dictate the intricacy of such values and are directly proportional to the number of vectors within them and proportional to the amount of digital matter that can be generated. Analyzing them will allow them to filter curvature information to create distinct force fields through vectors that create categorized patterns for three-dimensional formal expressions along with the mesh. Forces with various speeds and intensities are introduced and re-introduced, seen as a means of influences in computable forces that influence digital matter generating discrete pipes and/or primitives (boxes, spheres) informed by such forces. Algorithmically computable forces are transformed into additive computational assemblies allowing in its materialization the definition of every component that forms the overall geometry in an evolved and tectonic – or a self-aggregation system. The more influence, the more complexity in digital perceptive and distinct conditions. In terms of representation, artificial lights and shadows are introduced as part of the reinforcement and manipulation of geometry to highlight unseen conditions within the object.

Participants will learn (Rhinoceros, Grasshopper):
- Introduction to Rhinoceros and Grasshopper interface.
- Generation of solids (surfaces and meshes).
- Image sampling and remapping.
- Mesh distributions and subdivisions.
- Mesh population and abundance.
- Mesh simplex and 4D noise alterations.
- Mesh curvature analysis.
- Mesh data filtering.
- Analysis and filtering mesh complex patterns.
- Fields and forces operations.
- Piping, discrete curves, rails, operations.
- Artificial lights, shadows and real time rendering.

These operations are all performed within Rhino/Grasshopper, in combination with a set of plug-ins that include Weaverbird, Mesh analysis, Pufferfish, Lunchbox.

**Phase 2**
Additive Fields & Forces in motion: MASH Maya.
After introducing the participants to Maya basic polygonal modeling, this workflow focuses on form-finding and real-time representation as design strategy by controlling time and physics (influencers, orientations, speed, collisions, resistance) in Maya’s MASH to produce synthetic qualities and conditions. The geometry (curves, meshes, faces) are altered through duplicates and repetitions with mirror cuts based on Cartesian axes allowing to create the collision and intersection between geometries. The second condition adds to it a single unit -predefined changeable form- that will be repeated in every edge, vertex or face of the geometry, and can be distributed and organized proportionally to extrapolate a kind of sensible geometry that can be exposed to dynamic variables. Physics and time-based notations -computable effects such as influencers with orientation, rotation, and offset- are introduced through computer-controlled simulations, becoming a factor within the process that allows the progressive self-calculations and automation of infinite alterations. 

Participants will learn (Autodesk Maya):
- Introduction to Maya interface.
- Introduction to basic polygonal modeling.
- Introduction to Maya MASH.
- Introduction to animation tools.
- Animated operations such as dynamic mirroring and morphing.
- Animated parts of an object (curves, vertex, faces).
- Time-based techniques to create motion and interactive form-finding.
- Real-time design alternating and manipulating time, forces and physics such as resistance, collisions, orientations, influencers and the object itself.
- Real-time representation using lights and materials in Arnold.

*See relevant images attached as examples. The results are videos, but in the examples are a sequence of frames since only images were accepted.

**Phase 3**
Superobject: After effects.
Combining previous phases into a mutable and hybrid dynamic representation.

The students will learn (After Effects):
- Introduction to After Effects interface.
- Media production and combination of frames.
- Introduction and manipulation of presets.
- Video rendering.
