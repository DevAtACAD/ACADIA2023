Participants will be asked to download the following free software as well as a pre-packaged folder with required code libraries: Atom (https://atom.io/), Chrome (and WebServer for Chrome plugin), any terminal client (Cmder for Windows or iTerm2 for Mac recommended, though the built-in terminals work, too). Participants may also wish to sign up for a Heroku.com and github.com account beforehand, if they wish, though this will also be covered in the workshop."]

**Abstract**: Today, it is difficult to separate the process of designing and the software used to realize said design. While Alberti may have established one of the earliest distinctions between the ideal design and the physical realization of it, the emergence of software has collapsed this traditional flow of creativity to the extent that digital tools are no longer the tools for making: they are primarily tools for thinking.
This workshop takes on the premise that software is an ingrained part of the creative process and that real-time technologies such as internet browsers and design tools push back not only on acts of design, but also on our social consciousness. We will find that to draw on a screen is not simply to dream a perfect image and reproduce it flawlessly with interface tools but is instead a collaborative negotiation with these powerful platforms and the data managed within them. Participants will investigate how web-based drawing apps can be easily built and deployed using open-source and freely accessible tools. Together we will cover introductory graphics programming with the p5js JavaScript library and deployment using NodeJS. Using code and internet browsers as sites for inquiry, participants will develop simple apps that showcase how architectural effects can be explored through the screen and engender discussions about perception and use.

**Description**: The purpose of this workshop is twofold: pragmatically, it is to learn how to use the programming language JavaScript (p5js) to make interactive and dynamic web-based installations, and conceptually, it is to discuss the accessibility of open-source design tools and programming as a liberating act. Participants will be introduced to several freely accessible tools and methods for writing code, publishing that code, and deploying it to an online server. We will cover the following software: Atom (for writing code), Git (for tracking versioning), Github (for hosting files), and Heroku (for deploying apps for free). We will also cover introductions to the p5js graphics programming library and the NodeJS runtime for packaging apps. The material outcome of this workshop will be individual web-based drawing apps accessible online immediately after the workshop (using Heroku).
The contexts for this workshop are the tradition of architectural drawing and experimental software design. We will draw from both worlds to create drawing instruments (not necessarily tools that have utility) that can be tuned to achieve different visual effects. They may respond to drawing conventions such as snapping, dragging, clicking, and other physical interactions with software. As participants learn the practical methods, we will also actively discuss the role of software in design processes and the effects interfaces have on the design imaginary.
The methods will be primarily step-by-step tutorials, interrupted by more conceptual mini-lectures and background on the technology being used. It is important to discuss the concept behind browsers, servers, creative coding, open-source tools, as well as their technical aspects. We will also address programming as a way of liberating oneself from the constraints of proprietary software. The goal is to explore what internet browsers and open-source programming libraries can offer designers and architects from a critical perspective beyond utility.
