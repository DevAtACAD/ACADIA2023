Augmented Robotic Telepresence (ART) revisits the concept of “digital fabrication” as fabrication of digitality, through digitalizing the physical and physicalizing the digital. Employing native digital/physical interpreters—robot arms and augmented reality platforms—ART investigates possible mediums to hybridize realities of actual and virtual, to establish a workflow between a custom-made AR camera mounted on a robot arm, and a curated robotic motion, remotely programmed/controlled, as means of telepresence. Using the virtual workshop platform as an opportunity, the ART workshop will allow participants to remotely utilize the resources of the Robotically Augmented Design (RAD) Lab at Kent State University. The workshop instructors will enable the safe use of the robots, videography tools mounted on the robots, projection mapping, and custom robot end-effectors, for participants. Workshop participants will engage in a hybrid digital/physical workflow: developing a robotic videography/walkthrough path for the UR10 robot arm to capture a curated presence at RAD Lab, through hybridized real-time videography of the AR “scene,” developed using Maya and Unity3D.
