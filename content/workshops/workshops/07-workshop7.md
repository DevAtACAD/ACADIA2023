**Abstract**: Crocheting is a hands-on craft that involves repetitive manipulation of a single continuous thread with a hook-like tool to generate surfaces and 3D forms. The step-by-step stitching procedure in crocheting can be associated with algorithms of which the steps are defined through crochet patterns. Crochet patterns are text-based representations, similar to G-code in additive manufacturing. They enable the documentation and communication of crocheting know-how. 
In this workshop, participants from different locations will collectively design and crochet a branching spatial structure. Each participant will receive a Co-Crochet Kit prior to the workshop that will include crocheting materials. During the workshop, participants will first collectively design a branching structure and learn the basics of crocheting. They will then generate the crochet patterns of the components of the branching structure designed using a computer algorithm developed by the instructors that generates crochet patterns of 3D objects modeled in CAD software. At the end of the workshop, each participant will have the crochet patterns of at least one component to crochet. They will be provided a prepaid shipping label to ship the crocheted components to the instructors in the US. The instructors will assemble the crocheted components of the branching structure - “Voltron!”

**Description**: In this workshop, participants from different locations around the world will collectively design and crochet a branching spatial structure. 
Prior to the workshop, they will receive a Co-Crochet Kit that will include crocheting materials, such as crochet hooks and yarns. During the first day of the workshop, they will generate parametric branching structures in Grasshopper and discretize the structures into components. At the end of the first day, one design will be selected by the group. During the second day of the workshop, participants will be introduced to basic crocheting techniques for single crochet stitch and learn to use a computer algorithm to generate crocheting patterns for the components of the branching structure. Following the workshop, they will crochet the assigned components. They will be provided pre-paid shipping labels to ship the crocheted components to the instructors in the US. We will assemble the crocheted components into the branching structure. 

*Why will a Co-Crochet Kit be sent?*
Yarns and hooks used for crocheting significantly affect the outcome. Therefore, we want to make sure that all participants start by using the same type of yarn and hooks. 

*Why a branching structure?*
Through crocheting one can create 3D objects. The computer algorithm that we have developed can generate crocheting patterns of various types of 3D objects that are modeled in the computer, including branching structures. Since we want to collect and assemble the 3D components that the participants will crochet, we decided that a branching geometry would work best. 

*How to go from the 3D model in the computer to crocheting geometries?*
Physical constraints constitute the variables of the computer algorithm that we developed to generate crochet patterns of 3D objects modeled in the computer. These include determinate variables such as the material properties (yarn weight) and the tool size (crochet hook), but also indeterminate variables such as the effect of the crafter’s hand (grip on the yarn) while producing stitches. The latter, being unique for each individual crafter, is specified through a physical test swatch that the crafter crochets before running the computer algorithm.

*From digits to stitches: What is the output of the computer algorithm?*
The output of the computer algorithm is a crochet pattern in conventional text form to materialize the digital model. Following the resulting pattern, one is able to crochet the digital model by hand. The overall process is thus a transition from the digital to the physical, where physical constraints continuously inform this transition and shape the outcome.

*Wait, how do the “physical constraints continuously inform the transition from the digital to the physical and shape the outcome”?*
The computer algorithm generates the crochet patterns based on the 10x10 stitch-swatch that the users crochet before running the algorithm. The x-y dimensions of this stitch-swatch are the main inputs. This way, the physical variables associated with the yarn type, hook size, and most importantly crafter’s hand are combined into a single input. The crochet patterns are generated based on this input. This means that for the same 3D model, the computer algorithm generates unique crochet patterns for each individual. This way, the overall dimensions and forms of the discrete components that the participants of the workshop will crochet will be maintained and allow us to assemble them into a single structure.


**Important Note**: this workshop will require the use of a custom kit of materials/tools shipped by the instructors. Additional lead time and arrangements might be necessary to receive these on time. If you live outside the continental U.S. and believe you may have difficulties receiving the kit, please reach out to the instructors directly before enrolling in this workshop, or consider choosing a different one. ACADIA assumes no responsibility for late/lost kits, and cannot reimburse participants under these circumstances.
