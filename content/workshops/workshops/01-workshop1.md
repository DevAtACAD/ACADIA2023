**Abstract**: The workshop will explore ways to connect different neural networks (i.e. CycleGAN and StyleGAN) to explore the search space of architectural inspiration. Particular semantic references will serve as input for a pre-trained network which outputs data for further investigation using another neural network. The datasets will focus on exploring various resolutions of the urban domain and assess possibilities for emerging patterns, etc through interpolative and extrapolative strategies. From a process point of view we are interested in identifying relevance between certain types of neural networks and their ability to access creative potential in a targeted and/or heuristic/open-ended fashion. Furthermore, it is important to consider the capacity of these nested workflows to alter our immersion in the design investigation by accessing a design space that is otherwise beyond the designer’s reach. By moving beyond rule-based defined design spaces, AI's feature learning capabilities combined with  the incorporation of additional inspirational sources (outside architecture), enable creative exploration within an extended space. Our perception of these expanded design possibilities is crucial because it may point to the direction of future search.

The premise of this workshop lies in encoding design intentionality as a continuous set of actions, rather than separate input-output tasks. Workshop participants will be exposed to at least two main artificial neural network structures and the idiosyncrasies of data curation for each type. The goal is to develop a sensibility for such automated processes by leveraging the power of AI tools and also introduce them into ways of evaluating the outcomes from these workflows.  
Methods involve experimentation with multiple connected deep learning models, towards prototyping new design workflows. Testing and evaluation of experimental workflows will be pursued within a lens of process-creativity rather than product-creativity.
