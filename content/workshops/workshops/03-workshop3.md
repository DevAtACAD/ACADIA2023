**Abstract**:The ACADIA2021 workshop: Distributed Collaborations, takes Cloud Remote Control to the next level, allowing international participants to control robots in two different European locations. 
Workshop participants will remotely control robots at both the Chair of Individualized Production, RWTH Aachen, Germany, and at the Department of Creative Robotics, University of Arts and Industrial Design, Linz, Austria. 
It was at ACADIA2010, that Sigrid Brell-Cokcan and Johannes Braumann first introduced KUKA|prc, a new approach to parametric robotic production. Since then the robotic community has grown in unbelievable ways, built incredible structures and gathered for world class conferences from ACADIA to RobArch! 
10 years later, at ACADIA2020, Robots in Architecture members Sven Stumm and Ethan Kerber introduced KUKA|crc, a new approach to remote robotic control. This innovation allows international users to collaborate closely with robots while remaining safely socially distant. 
Since then, we have been improving the software, adding IoT infrastructure and readying this technology for rollout around the world.
KUKA|crc helps people learn about robots even if they can’t get in the lab. KUKA|crc also empowers you with a new cloud based IoT infrastructure allowing for multi robot factory setups and easy wireless integration of IoT devices and end effectors. 


**Description**: As online collaboration becomes a new normal, it is vital that we explore new ways of physically working together, and with robots, even across great distances. By extending Cloud Remote Control to multiple locations, we internationally distribute both design and fabrication in new integrated & automated processes. 
To continue educating artist’s, architects, and engineer’s in an accessible exciting workshop, we propose a collaborative process where each participant assembles an element of a structure robotically. The assembled piece is then instantiated in the user’s digital twin so that the next participant can continue building the structure, each participant sequentially taking turns to design and build a spontaneous construction.  This exploration will continue throughout the workshop, working together across international locations, allowing users to work on separate but related structures in unique locations from the safety of their office or home.
Participants will learn how to design robotic programs, from basic motion concepts to more developed strategies for manipulation of planes and generation of tool paths. The workshop will teach you how to connect to international robots, book access, push programs and monitor processes. You will leave with a deeper understanding of robotic workspaces and learn how to optimize paths to avoid constraints and collisions. 
We imagine a future you can access international robots as a service, simulate robotic capacities, get early design decision support and optimize for automation. We imagine a future where you can book operate and monitor robots when you need them and where you need them, depending on project location, material specification and cell configuration. 

Work with robots everywhere, from anywhere.
