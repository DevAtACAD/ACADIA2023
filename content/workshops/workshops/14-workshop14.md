**Description**: Learn about generative design and real-time multi-factor analysis in early-stage planning with Spacemaker. A significant part of value creation occurs in the early planning stages. However, a disproportionately low percentage of tech-investments is allocated to this segment. While uninformed decisions in this phase drive costs in later stages, too often, crucial information is not yet readily available and needs to be built up as we build our design on multiple assumptions. Smart algorithms, automated data-fetching, and the use of geo-referenced digital 3D twins of your site from day one can help solve this issue. How can we use the full potential of manual, parametric, and generative design features, and cloud technology to boost our design capabilities? How can we use real-time analysis to connect program, solar, wind, acoustic, view, and sustainability data to building form? How can we capture the power of AI while keeping full control over the results and always remaining in the driver’s seat? This workshop will introduce a rethought, networked workflow for early-stage site planning. Participants will learn how to frontload their design with information and make data driven decisions, spending less time on manual setup and more on creative decision making. Reduce risk with constant live-feedback and improve value by optimizing for density and living qualities at the same time. Each day will contain a combination of presentations and hands-on exercises. Participants will be contestants and jury in a small design competition at the conclusion of the workshop.

**Setup Requirements**
1.	Chrome browser
2.	Valid e-mail address
3.	It will be helpful if at all possible, to have 2 screens available for Zoom + Spacemaker. Please contact Lilli.Smith@autodesk.com if you have any problems with the set up so that we can try to help you in advance and won’t have to troubleshoot during the workshop.

**Pre-Reading**
To get the most out of the workshop, it will be helpful to be familiar with these resources:
1.	Watch the first 4 Spacemaker video tutorials you find under “introduction” following [this link](https://help.spacemaker.ai/en/collections/2644494-video-tutorials) (This takes less than 20 min)
2.	We encourage all participants to also watch the remaining video tutorials (this takes about 1h)
