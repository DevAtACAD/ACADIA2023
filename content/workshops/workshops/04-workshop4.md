**Abstract**:This workshop explores the intersection of game and AI as a novel way to approach architectural participatory generative design. The recent rapid advancement of machine learning and ai in architectural industries is operating with limitation to allow a wider audience or human perception. As architects and designers, allowing a wider spectrum of evaluation will be vital in the design process. Inspired by machine learning (ML) application in Unity3D as game design elements, there are potentials to promote the active participation of architects, artists and even the public in the design generation processes by gamification. In this workshop, we will explore novel generative design methodology driven by Reinforcement Learning combined with player active interaction, focusing on the actor-aware generation of logics and complex spatial perceptions. How can a machine think creatively? What may be the possible form generated from the active collaboration between AI and players? What are the machine-made elements that become unperceivable from a human? These questions approach the goals of AI proponents concerning the new generation of AI that would help designers through the novel augmentation of machine vision and automation. In the workshop, participants will work with a given set of reinforcement-learning-based frameworks and package in Unity3D to explore design ideas and potentials of perception-aware human-machine interaction.  Eventually, we will approach collective layers of design generation through human and AI collaboration. 


**Description**: 
In the near future of our industry, our context and ways of practice are to be in the constant shift by the constantly re-interpretation of data models, from natural/human to artificial/machine, and machine-assisted augmentation in design and human perception.  This workshop aims at constructing interrelation between AI and human design thinking, articulation, AI-informed-form-finding, and human-machine interactions in the future of design production
Often works that interest themselves with machine learning are designed and visualized from an alien perspective: that of an object on an empty field, and seen from far above, outside of the human field of view, roughly 1.8m off the ground. This has the side effect of making the resultant works of the unique combination of Humans and AI difficult to understand from the perspective of the everyman: how does one see oneself in space if there is no sense of scale, and no interaction with the perspectival nature of the eye? Once these spaces are visualized from the first person, they often feel discordant, and under designed. The machine and human have operated on the macro scale, leaving the micro scale off of the drawing board, as it were. What if we, instead, operate on this micro scale? Instead of forming whole architectures, focus on the minutia, the single experience of a space?
Thus, this workshop will apply Reinforcement learning in Unity (ML-Agents) and Unity’s gameplay function as the technique frameworks. we will use state-of-the-art techniques in Unity to generate methodologies for the participatory design that involves both human player and AI-agent. We will explore the methods and meaning of RL in design practice involving subjective factors. How can a machine think creatively? What may be the possible form generated from the active collaboration between AI and players? What are the machine-made elements that become unperceivable from a human? These questions approach the goals of AI proponents concerning the new generation of AI that would help designers through the novel augmentation of machine vision and automation.

**Methods**:
Establish workflows during the technique workshops for tool-based exploration and experiment in game design environment through Unity3D and its package ML-agents.
Extensively explore the potential of AI and its interaction through framed problems and discussion. E.g. we can set up a quick web game to be tested by other participants and guests.
Evaluate design results by investigating the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration and translating the model to other platforms.

**Learning Outcome**:
- Understand the fundamental concepts behind AI-informed design (especially Reinforcement learning)
- Know programming and operational concepts of RL and gameplay in Unity3D 
- Understand the potentials, constraints and know-how to develop an interactive application for design articulation
