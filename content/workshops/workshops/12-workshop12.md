**Abstract**: In this workshop, participants will learn how to generate the geometry of lightweight and expressive structures using the Combinatorial Equilibrium Modeling (CEM) framework, a form-finding method based on vector-based graphic statics, and its computational implementation, COMPAS CEM. COMPAS CEM is a new design tool written in pure Python that optimizes structural geometries to best meet geometry and force-related constraints. To this end, the tool uses automatic differentiation, a set of algorithmic techniques responsible for making modern machine learning models to learn.

Through a series of guided exercises, participants will gain hands-on experience with COMPAS CEM, and learn how to use it from their command line interface and inside Grasshopper. The theme of the workshop focuses on the design of the load-bearing structure of a staircase, an intimate spatial bridge that connects different floors and areas in a building. Participants will explore digitally how the manipulation of the connectivity and the internal force states in a structure can steer the generation of a catalog of forms that are elegant, safe and material-efficient. Besides acquiring foundational understanding of how constrained form-finding works, participants will walk out of the workshop with a set of digital form-found structures, which can be seamlessly ingested by other packages in the COMPAS ecosystem.

**Description**: Our main intent is to illustrate how constrained form-finding approaches can be integrated into contemporary design processes to create performant shapes from the ground up. We share the vision that structural performance can co-exist with other non-structural design objectives, and that numerical optimization is one way to achieve such integration efficiently and transparently.
The workshop will follow three main thrusts. We will first introduce participants to the relevant theoretical background of form-finding, the CEM framework and numerical optimization with condensed lectures. To get practical experience with our software stack, participants will be guided next through a number of hands-on exercises that gradually increase in complexity. We plan to close the workshop with a capstone exercise with the help of the instruction team. Participants will be asked to use the tools and concepts learned during the workshop to form-find the structural geometry of a new staircase, or to replicate the structural geometry of an existing staircase of their choice.
