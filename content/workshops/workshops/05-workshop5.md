**Abstract:** Augmented Reality (AR) and real time rendering are becoming important technologies for creating remote social experiences, visualizations, and training simulations in a number of fields. In the architecture industry, this technology not only offers a new medium for creating visual assets but opens up possibilities for new forms of communication and coordination between various trades including architects, contractors, and clients through facilitating spatially calibrated digital interactions. In order to speculate on these possibilities, our workshop will explore the idea of “Augmented Architectural Details.” These will take the form of small-scale, spatially-calibrated AR overlays which explain assembly systems through human interaction. 
This workshop will provide students with tools to author digital content to a custom AR application using the Unity3D Game Engine. Students will gain skills in animation, interaction, lighting, and mesh optimization and learn how to translate these effects to an AR interface. In order to facilitate rapid experimentation with AR content, students will be provided with an AR application that will allow them to exchange and import Unity Asset Bundles onto their iOS or Android phones in real time. This will focus the workshop on developing technical and critical thinking skills around the topic of Augmented Architectural Details.

**Description**: Real time rendering and spatial computing represent a paradigm shift from static images, pre-rendered animations, and 2D media as the dominant form of architectural representation. The designer’s toolkit needs to be realigned to take advantage of these technologies and shift towards experiential and interaction based forms of design communication. Furthermore, spatial computing offers the ability to accurately overlay these real-time rendered digital experiences on top of real world contexts.
We will focus this workshop on developing AR content for smart phones and with multiplayer frameworks. Producing AR content no longer requires specialized equipment, controlled conditions, or expensive hardware setups, but is accessible to anyone with a smartphone, leveling the playing field for producing architectural experiences and easily sharing them. Multiplayer frameworks, often used for game development, are now finding their way into these forms of architectural representations, allowing for remote collaboration. 
The workshop leaders will explore these ideas and technologies by teaching technical skills in Unity3D and leading the students through a workflow that allows them to build experiences on their phones. Students will be provided with a pre-published AR application that will allow them to exchange and import Unity Asset Bundles onto their iOS or Android devices without having to go through the full App publishing process. 
 
Students will learn the following concepts/workflows during the workshop:
- Concepts around simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and both “markered” and “markerless” AR.
- Modeling, lighting, rendering, interaction, and animation skills in the Unity3D Game Engine
- Specific workflows for authoring AR content in Unity3D
- How to calibrate relationships between virtual and real objects
- How to prototype and share Asset Bundle Packages for use in an AR application specifically created for this workshop
