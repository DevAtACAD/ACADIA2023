    As architects, engineers, educators & builders, we rely on working closely together to create innovative structures. Inspired by this new need for social distancing, Robots in Architecture Research has developed a cloud-based approach to working remotely with robotics: KUKA|crc. Cloud Robot Control enables industrial access through online collaboration. In this workshop, participants will learn to remotely simulate robotic movements, program robots over the cloud, monitor fabrication progress and adapt in real time to inaccuracies in material, all while controlling the process from their own international location. The goal of this workshop is to advance the capability of remote robotic fabrication while prototyping new methods of adaptivity based on available process data. Construction relies on large international teams collaborating in close quarters to create ambitious structures. Inspired by this challenge, the aim of Cloud Robot Control is to extend remote robotic capabilities to the building site, enabling automated, adaptive and collaborative processes to bring a new level of digitization and innovation to the construction industry. Through the ACADIA 2020 Cloud Robot Control Workshop, an international group of artists, architects, and engineers will have a chance to experience automated construction in a new digital way.
