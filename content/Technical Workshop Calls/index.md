**ACADIA Announces Open Call for Workshop Proposals for 2021 Conference**

**REALIGNMENTS: Toward Critical Computation**

In addition to the lineup of curated and sponsored workshops (to be announced in July), ACADIA is pleased to announce an open call for workshop proposals. The 2021 ACADIA Conference Chairs seek proposals for workshops that engage with the conference theme Realignments: Toward Critical Computation, are collaboratively developed, intersectional, and are led by authors at two or more institutions. The goal is to present workshop leaders and participants with an opportunity to learn and experiment in remoteness, improvised virtual communities, and retooling to address critical needs.
 
Workshops will take place over two days, September 11-12, a few weeks preceding the conference, and will take place online via Zoom or similar video conferencing platform. Workshop leaders will receive a modest honorarium for their work, to be finalized when workshop costs and capacity are determined. Submissions will be jury selected and workshop outcomes will be presented by the authors and participants during the ACADIA conference and published as a special feature on the ACADIA website.
