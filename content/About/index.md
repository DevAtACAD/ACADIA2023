**ABOUT ACADIA**

ACADIA was formed for the purpose of facilitating communication and critical thinking regarding the use of computers in architecture, planning and building science. The organization is committed to the research and development of computational methods that enhance design creativity, rather than simply production, and that aim at contributing to the construction of humane physical environments. A particular focus is education and the software, hardware and pedagogy involved in education. Please visit the main ACADIA website for more information.

{{< bio src="JaneScott.jpg" name="Dr. Jane Scott" url="http://bbe.ac.uk/" affiliation="Academic Track Fellow, Newcastle University" >}}

Jane Scott is an Academic Track Fellow in the Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment at Newcastle University, UK. Her research is located at the interface of programmable textiles, architecture and biology. Jane’s work challenges the established understanding of smart materials for architecture; applying principles derived from biology to the design of environmentally responsive textile systems. Jane is currently developing a new generation of Living Textiles for the built environment. These adaptive responsive bio/knit composites will provide a programmable interface for both indoor and outdoor environments. 
 
Before joining Newcastle University, Jane was an academic at the University of Leeds and held a Visiting Research Fellowship in Biomimicry at Central Saint Martins. She completed her PhD, Programmable Knitting, at the Textiles Futures Research Centre, Central Saint Martins. In 2016 this work was awarded the Autodesk ACADIA Emerging Research Award. Her work has been exhibited widely and she has presented her research at major international events.

{{< bio src="JoseLuis.jpg" name="Dr. Jose Luis García del Castillo y López" url="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/jose-luis-garcia-del-castillo-lopez/" affiliation="Lecturer in Architectural Technology, Harvard Graduate School of Design" >}}

Jose Luis García del Castillo y López is an architect, computational designer and educator. He advocates for a future where programming and code are tools as natural to artists as paper and pencil. In his work, he explores how interfaces for concurrent human-machine collaboration can lead to increased levels of creativity for both parties involved.

Jose Luis is Lecturer in Architectural Technology at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, from where he holds a Doctor of Design and Master in Design Studies in Technology degrees. He is also the co-founder of ParametricCamp, a digital platform to promote computational literacy amongst designers.

{{< bio id="Kathrin" src="Kathrin Dörfler.jpg" name="Dr. Kathrin Dörfler" url="https://www.ar.tum.de/en/df/team/kathrin-doerfler-prof-dr-sc-eth/" affiliation="Assistant Professor, Technical University of Munich" >}}
Kathrin Dörfler is an Assistant Professor at the Technical University of Munich, setting up a research group for Digital Fabrication at the Department of Architecture and the Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering. At the interface between architecture and robotics, Kathrin researches digital design and robot-supported construction processes in architecture and their synthesis in new technologies. She is particularly interested in exploring the architectural implications of mobile robotics and augmented reality technologies for additive manufacturing in construction and researching methods for their implementation. 

She has a Master’s degree in Architecture from TU Vienna (2012) and a PhD degree from ETH Zurich (2018), carried out at Gramazio Kohler Research at the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Digital Fabrication, ETH Zurich.

{{< bio id="June" src="June Grant.jpg" name="June A. Grant" url="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/brief/386429/june-grant" affiliation="" >}}

June A. Grant, RA, NOMA, is a visionary architect, Founder and Design Principal at blinkLAB architecture; a boutique research-based architecture and urban design studio that re-thinks conventional approaches. Launched in 2015, BlinkLAB was created based on Ms. Grant’s 20 years experience in architecture, design and urban regeneration of cities and communities.  Her design approach rests on an avid belief in cultural empathy, data research and new technologies as integral to design futures and design solutions.  Because we are designers committed to new forms of knowledge through making, we prefer to situate ourselves in the middle of catalytic design - where new challenges and emerging opportunities are addressed through multi-layered thinking and design. 


blinkLAB has three mandates - A commitment to Design Exploration, Advocacy for Holistic Solutions and the Integration of Technology as a central component for a regenerative society.


Ms. Grant is also the immediate Past-President of the San Francisco Chapter of the National Organization of Minority Architects (SFNOMA); Board member of ACADIA, a YBCA100 honoree, 2020 CEDAW Human Rights honoree, and the 2020, 10th Annual J. Max Bond Jr. Lecturer.
