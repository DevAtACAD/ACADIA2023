At the convergence of social, political, and environmental crises and a global pandemic, ACADIA2021 reflects on
realigning our practices to allow for alternative and constructive ways of knowledge and world making to address
these issues.
Computational systems have enabled creative solutions and innovations that benefit societies and demonstrate the
ingenuity of the design community. However, left unchecked, they can also exacerbate issues of inequality, bias,
access and perpetuate methods and histories that may harm rather than foster positive change.

With these entanglements of technology, power, and society as a backdrop, 
*ACADIA2021, Realignments: Toward Critical Computation,*
asks us to question our current practices and priorities to address the urgency of the now. This conference
provides a platform to engage with conversations, tools and methodologies that include knowledges and communities
currently missing to enable realignments toward inclusive and critical practices in architecture across different scales.
How can the computational design community critically address questions of emancipation,
intersectionality and our computational publics?

*Realignments: Toward Critical Computation* takes the occasion of ACADIAâ€™s 40th Anniversary to invite
contributions of recent and emerging work in computational design, fabrication, and construction in the built
environment. We encourage conceptualizations of emancipatory computation, computational diversity, and experiments
in collaboration, participation, and empowerment.

The 2021 ACADIA conference will be a virtual and global event, featuring peer-reviewed, juried, and curated
content, as well as keynotes and panel discussions.
