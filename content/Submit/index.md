**Submission Guidelines**

ACADIA 2021 invites three types of submissions:

1. TECHNICAL PAPERS (Full Papers or Work-In-Progress)
2. PROJECTS
3. FIELD NOTES

All works will be published in either the Conference Proceedings or Exhibition Catalog.

**1. Peer-Reviewed Research Papers**

[Submit Papers Here](https://2021-acadia-papers.scholasticahq.com/)

We invite papers submission in two categories:

(a) Technical Papers describe work that is embedded within significant bodies of research or creative practice. A technical paper is categorized by research-based projects, design processes, and/or novel techniques and methods which contribute to the advancement of the field of computational design. Papers must emphasize the significance of the work and its historical, scientific, and/or theoretical context. Papers may also be entirely historical or theoretical in nature (max. 4,000 words).

(b) Work-in-Progress Papers describe developing work or an individual project which has yet to be placed within a larger context of ongoing research. A work-in-progress paper is categorized by a novel project, method and/or design approach which has the potential to contribute to the advancement of the field of computational design (max. 2,000 words).

 All identifying names, places, programs, institutions, and firms must be omitted from the paper to maintain an anonymous review process. All paper submissions shall adhere to the [2021 ACADIA Publication Ethics Guidelines](http://acadia.org/content/conferences#publication_ethics).

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and authors will be invited to produce a short video presentation for the conference. Published papers will be included in the CumInCad database. All ACADIA papers are searchable through Web of Science Platform and Scopus.

Papers must utilize the style guide provided through this link: [Technical Paper style guide](./ACADIA_2021_FullPaper_Instructions.docx).

The text description should comprise the first page of the PDF and each image should be formatted to fit on a single page, oriented either horizontally or vertically. Captions are strongly encouraged as part of the image pages.
