**SUBMISSION GUIDELINES**

**ACADIA 2021 submissions have closed!**

All works will be published in either the Conference Proceedings or Exhibition Catalog.

**1. Peer-Reviewed Research Papers**

We invite papers submission in two categories:

(a) Technical Papers describe work that is embedded within significant bodies of research or creative practice. A technical paper is categorized by research-based projects, design processes, and/or novel techniques and methods which contribute to the advancement of the field of computational design. Papers must emphasize the significance of the work and its historical, scientific, and/or theoretical context. Papers may also be entirely historical or theoretical in nature (max. 4,000 words).

(b) Work-in-Progress Papers describe developing work or an individual project which has yet to be placed within a larger context of ongoing research. A work-in-progress paper is categorized by a novel project, method and/or design approach which has the potential to contribute to the advancement of the field of computational design (max. 2,000 words).

 All identifying names, places, programs, institutions, and firms must be omitted from the paper to maintain an anonymous review process. All paper submissions shall adhere to the [2021 ACADIA Publication Ethics Guidelines](http://acadia.org/content/conferences#publication_ethics).

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and authors will be invited to produce a short video presentation for the conference. Published papers will be included in the CumInCad database. All ACADIA papers are searchable through Web of Science Platform and Scopus.

Papers must utilize the style guide provided through this link: [Technical Paper style guide](./ACADIA_2021_FullPaper_Instructions.docx). 

- Submission Deadline: July 18, 2021
- Notification of Acceptance: By September 14, 2021
- Revised Papers Due: October 8, 2021
- Presentation Videos Due: October 15, 2021

**2. Projects**

Project submissions should consist of a title, a project description of no more than 600 words (excluding endnotes and captions), plus a maximum of 10 images, formatted within a letter-sized or A4 document (landscape layout) and submitted via the conference submission website as a single, multipage PDF. The text description should comprise the first page of the PDF and each image should be formatted to fit on a single page, oriented either horizontally or vertically. Captions are strongly encouraged as part of the image pages. 

Project submissions will be blind peer reviewed. Projects selected for the conference will be published. Selected submissions may be invited to contribute a video presentation and/or participate in a discussion panel during the virtual conference.

All identifying names, places, programs, institutions, and firms must be omitted from the paper to maintain an anonymous review process.All project submissions shall adhere to the [2021 ACADIA Publication Ethics Guidelines](http://acadia.org/content/conferences#publication_ethics).

Project must utilize the style guide provided through this link: [Project style guide](./ACADIA_2021_ProjectFieldNotes_StyleGuide.docx).

- Submission Deadline: July 18, 2021
- Notification of Acceptance: By September 20, 2021
- Revised/formatted Materials Due: October 8, 2021


**3. Field Notes**

Field Notes category invites the submission of shorter pieces that may include provocative artifacts regarding the culture and practice of critical computational design: experimental ideas, behind-the-scenes, observations, brief narratives, provocations, and manifestoes.

Field Notes submissions shall consist of a short text, annotated images, image-based essays, or similar. Emphasis is on content rather than format. Submissions will be jury selected and published. Selected submissions may be invited to participate in a discussion panel during the virtual conference.

All project submissions shall adhere to the [2021 ACADIA Publication Ethics Guidelines](http://acadia.org/content/conferences#publication_ethics).

Project must utilize the style guide provided through this link: [FieldNotes style guide](./ACADIA_2021_ProjectFieldNotes_StyleGuide.docx).

- Submission Requirements: 800-1000 word texts; images are permitted and image-based essays are also welcome.
- Field Notes Submission Deadline: July 18, 2021
- Notification of Acceptance: By September 20, 2021
